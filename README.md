# Advent-of-Code
Repository of my solutions to Advent of Code problems.

Note that in 2017 I was focused on solving the problems as fast as possible and didn't change the code at all afterwords. In 2018 I am sometimes still trying to solve the problems quickly but I am also going back to make the code more readable.

In addition the problems from 2017 are in python2 instead of python3 and I got busy just before Christmas and never went back to finish the last few problems.
